# webpack-gh-pages
Minimal demo site using webpack to deploy on GitHub Pages

The site started by following Webpack's [getting started] tutorial. Then, we
added the `magic_message.js` module to get packed together with `index.js`.

After cloning the source code with git, install the node packages.

    npm install

Build the web site:

    npm run build

Run the web site:

    npm run serve
